ASSIGNMENT 5:

PROCESS OF BUILDING THE APP:
1. create a folder and name it as you please.
2. open it in VS code and run the expo commands to generate the qr code that will help you connect your phone to expo.
3. Clone repository to github.
4. From my app, I created a new card using figma because I felt everyone will be using the same card and the app will look the same. so I created a new credit card and added it to my folder.
5. I uploaded all images and icons I will use in this app and imported the Image component.
6. I first created the Home page, where I found some little difficulties but with the help of the chatgpt and youtube I pulled through.
7. I continued to create a page named Settings.js that will serve as the other page in this app. The settings page has a toggle button that displays a dark mode or light mode when clicked on. 
8. the Home page has a navigation tab bellow the screen that helps in navigation in the app.
9. I installed all packages for navigation in the home.js and settings.js to enable navigation.
10. I reduced all images to fit the screen.
11. To make the screen or pages scrollable, I imported scrollView component in the Home.js.
12. All components that will be used in the app must be imported before it runs.
